# Bright TV Audience Analysis
##Introduction

Bright TV recently launched a new data initiative aimed at understanding viewer behavior, audience engagement, and content performance. As part of this initiative, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Bright TV audience dataset to uncover insights into viewership trends, popular channels, audience demographics, and peak viewing times.

Using Snowflake SQL for data cleaning and transformation, and Excel for pivot table visualization, this project delivers actionable insights to support marketing, content programming, and advertising strategies.

## Problem Statement

Bright TV has faced challenges in recent months due to limited visibility into audience preferences, viewing patterns, and content engagement. Decision-making was primarily based on assumptions rather than data, resulting in:

Inefficient content scheduling, missing key time slots when viewers are most active.

Poor audience segmentation, making it difficult to target specific viewer groups with relevant content.

Limited understanding of which channels and shows perform best across different demographics.

To address these gaps, Bright TV introduced a data-driven strategy to analyze viewership behavior, aiming to improve programming decisions, advertising effectiveness, and audience retention.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to analyze Bright TV’s viewership data to help stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions. The focus areas include:

Identifying top-performing TV channels.

Understanding audience distribution by age, gender, race, and province.

Discovering peak viewing times throughout the day.

Measuring engagement patterns to guide advertising and content strategy.

## Objectives

To achieve these goals, the following steps were carried out:

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Combined user profile and viewership datasets.

Handled missing values (nulls) and standardized data formats (dates, gender, race).

Data Analysis

Segmented viewers by age group, gender, race, and province.

Categorized viewing times into meaningful time buckets (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, etc.).

Measured viewership per channel and demographic group.

Visualization & Insights

Created pivot tables and charts in Excel to visualize audience behavior and trends.

Summarized actionable insights to guide programming and marketing strategies.

## Tools Used

Snowflake – SQL queries for data cleaning, transformation, and combining datasets.

Excel – Pivot tables and charts for visualization and insights presentation.

Miro – Used for planning and mapping analysis workflow.

Canva – For presentation of results and insights.
